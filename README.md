# 🧩 Maze Runner Game (JavaFX)

## 📝 Project Overview

Maze Runner Game is a **graphical maze-solving game built with JavaFX**. You control a player navigating through a visible maze grid, searching for the exit while avoiding walls. 
The game provides an interactive, visually engaging experience with intuitive controls and instant feedback.

## 🚀 What’s Implemented

- **Graphical Maze Display** 🎨  
  The maze is rendered as a grid in a JavaFX window, showing walls, the player, and the exit.

- **Player Movement** 🕹️  
  Move your player using on-screen buttons or arrow keys. Valid moves are highlighted, and the GUI updates instantly.

- **Solution Button** 🧠  
  Stuck? Press the **Solution** button to watch the game walk you through the shortest path from your current position to the exit, step by step!

- **Win Detection** 🏁  
  The game detects when you reach the exit and displays a victory message.

- **Move Tracking** ⏱️  
  Keeps count of the player’s moves, encouraging efficiency and replayability.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Launch the Game**: Start the JavaFX application to see the maze grid and player piece.
2. **Navigate**: Use arrow keys or GUI controls to move. Walls (`#`) block movement, open spaces (` `) are walkable, and the exit is clearly marked.
3. **Solution Walkthrough**: Stuck? Hit the **Solution** button to watch the app highlight and walk the player through the shortest route to the exit.
4. **Reach the Exit**: Find your way to the exit tile. Upon success, the game congratulates you and shows your performance stats.
5. **Restart/Load Maze**: Play again or try a new maze layout for more challenges.
